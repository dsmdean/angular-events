# angular-events
Project created during the course "Angular Fundamentals" on Pluralsight.

Description of the course:
In this course, you will learn how simple it is to use Angular to create maintainable and testable single page applications. You will learn how to: bootstrap your Angular application; use AngularJS markup and expressions; create and use controllers; use built-in services and create custom services; turn your application into a SPA using routing; and create your own custom elements and handle events using directives. You will also learn how AngularJS allows you to do all thing using test-driven-development.

After finishing the course I continued working on the project until it was complete and I added a rest server using node, express and mongodb.
